Overview - 

For this project, I created two Python scripts to evaluate data from csv files. For the first script (PyBank), I evaluated monthly data regarding profits and losses to determine the total number of months included, the net total of the profits/losses, the average change in profits/losses, as well as, the dates and amounts of both the greatest increase and greatest decrease in profits/losses over the months included in the data. For the second script (PyPoll), I evaluated voting data to determine the total number of votes cast, a list of candidates who were voted for, the total number and percentage of the votes each candidate received, and the winner of the election. The pertinent data created from each script were also exported to a text file, located in their respective Analysis folder.
